# DataError
Defines a DataError exception class interface, subclassing ArgumentTypeError. 
The class is an Abstract Factory. There are six method signatures. Three 
signatures are `public`, and three are `private`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'data_error'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install data_error

## Usage
There are six total method signatures, all instance signatures. Three 
signatures are `public`, and three are `private`.

### Public methods
The three public signatures are the constructor, `message()`, and 
`try(argument_type)`.

#### `initialize(message = nil)`
The constructor.

#### `message()`
Getter method. Gets and returns the explanation.

#### `try(argument_type)`
In the case the object is a data type instance, and is an acceptable type, 
raises. Takes an unknown type object.

### Private methods
The three `private` method signatures are `message=(explanation)`, 
`choose(explanation)`, and `type?(presumed_data)`.

#### `message=(explanation)`
Setter method. Sets the message attribute the argued explanation 
String.

#### `choose(explanation)`
Chooses the appropriate explanation. In the case no explanation String was 
argued, the default explanation is the explanation.

#### `type?(presumed_data)`
Boolean method. Returns true in the case the argument is the appropriate type, 
and returns false otherwise.
